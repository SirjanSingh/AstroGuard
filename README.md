**Theme:** Object Detection in Simulated Space Environments

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In the high-risk environment of a space station, it’s crucial to detect essential tools like fire extinguishers, oxygen tanks, and toolboxes in real time to ensure crew safety and mission efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a **fast, lightweight, and accurate object detection model** capable of identifying critical equipment from space station surveillance feeds.

---

## 🧠 Approach

We built our detection pipeline using **YOLOv8** and focused on the following object classes:

- 🧯 Fire Extinguisher  
- 🧰 Toolbox  
- 🛢️ Oxygen Tank  

---

## ⚙️ Model Development Process

We went through several iterations to find the most optimal configuration for both accuracy and generalization:

### 1. ✅ YOLOv8s (Small) – 40 Epochs (Best Model)
- Best model with balanced performance  
- Fast inference and high accuracy  
- Chosen as the final model for submission

### 2. YOLOv8m (Medium) – 50 Epochs
- Improved training metrics (lower loss, higher precision)  
- **But**: Test performance began to fluctuate (overfitting symptoms)

### 3.  YOLOv8s – 50 Epochs (`train10`)
- Stable metrics  
- Comparable to final model but slightly heavier

### 4.  YOLOv8m – 50 Epochs (`train7`)
- More complex model  
- Slight overfitting observed

| `train4`       | ?      | s    | 86.75   | 75.51    | 81.24   | 76.03   |
| `train10`      | 50     | s    | 86.68   | 76.07    | 81.34   | 76.18   |
| `train7`       | 50     | m    | 86.68   | 76.07    | 81.34   | 76.18   |
| `train_5epochs`| 5      | s    | 71.79   | 62.77    | 60.51   | 48.96   |

📌 Based on overall performance and generalization, **`train5` (YOLOv8s – 40 Epochs)** was selected as the **final model**.
